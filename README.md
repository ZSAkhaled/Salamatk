# Salamatk

## Introduction

Salamatk is a Python-based project focusing on Computer Vision for detecting abnormal behavior, specifically designed for monitoring drivers. The system intelligently analyzes visual data to identify harmful behaviors, providing real-time notifications to the driver. This innovative approach aims to enhance road safety by alerting drivers to potentially dangerous actions, promoting safer driving habits.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - OpenCV (cv2) for image processing tasks.
  - Ultralytics for implementing YOLO models for object detection.
  - Pygame for interactive alerts and simulations.
  - Matplotlib for generating plots and visualizations.

## Setup

To run this project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Open the project directory and launch `main.ipynb` with your own dataset on Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab to explore the notebook and chage the dataset directory.

## Usage

- Sequentially execute the cells within `main.ipynb` to see the project's functionality unfold.
- Monitor for real-time alerts and visualizations indicating detected abnormal behaviors.
- The file path needs to be changed so read each cell carefully and then after making changes execute it.

## Visualizations

The project includes several key visualizations that are essential for understanding the data and evaluating the performance of the detection models:
- **confusion_matrix.png**: Displays the model's confusion matrix.
- **F1_curve.png**: Illustrates the F1 score across various thresholds.
- **P_curve.png**, **R_curve.png**: Present the precision and recall curves, respectively.
- **results.png**: Summarizes overall results and key metrics.
